George Stephans
---------------

| ![George Stephans]({{< resource_file ae1b1b3a-d06a-6ac3-b234-2627de6d577f >}}) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} George Stephans (PhD U Pennsylvania) is a Senior Research Scientist in the Laboratory for Nuclear Science and a Senior Lecturer in the Physics Department at MIT. His research work involves collisions of very high energy atomic nuclei. The goal of these studies is to understand the behavior of systems of sub-atomic constituents (quarks and gluons) at extremely high temperatures and densities. His most recent experiments use the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. He has decades of experience teaching physics at MIT. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  

Anna Frebel
